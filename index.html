											<h2>Predict the rating for a User / Item pair using Jaccard Similarity</h2>
                                			<p>In my project, I aimed to predict future user book ratings using machine learning techniques, including Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Bag of Words, and Jaccard Similarity. I conducted data exploration, encoded IDs, and implemented these methods for rating predictions based on previous ratings and reviews. Jaccard Similarity outperformed Bag of Words, offering a more accurate prediction with a lower Mean Square Error (MSE) of 1.837. This project showcases the potential of machine learning in recommendation systems and predictive analytics.</p>
